SlimRSS
==============

A "mobile first" reader for [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org).


How to use it?
--------------

You should install the files in a directory on the same host as your TT-RSS install.
As the webapp uses AJAX calls to access the API, it should be hosted on the **same domain name**.

Use of this webapp requires TT-RSS's external APIs. They are enabled through TT-RSS's preferences:
 * in *Tiny Tiny RSS* go into `Actions` -> `Preferences`
 * `Configuration` -> `Enable external API`
